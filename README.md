JS: The Interesting Parts
=========================

This is (/ will be) an ongoing collection of JavaScript that I find interesting or useful&mdash;not only JS-specific stuff, but also standard algorithms and data structures. Maybe you&rsquo;ll find it interesting or useful, too.

Curious? Clone it and grab the dependencies with `npm install`, navigate to `bin` in the directory you&rsquo;re interested in, and run the script there&mdash;e.g., `./selectionSort 3 1 2`. 

(You&rsquo;ll need Node and npm, of course, and you might need to make the `bin/` files executable first.)
