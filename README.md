JS: The Interesting Parts
=========================

This is an ongoing collection of JavaScript that I find interesting or useful&mdash;not only JS-specific stuff, but also standard algorithms and data structures. Maybe you&rsquo;ll find it interesting or useful, too.

Curious? Clone it and grab the dependencies with `npm install`, navigate to the directory you&rsquo;re interested in, and run the script there&mdash;e.g., `./selectionSort 3 1 2`. Or see everything at once: from the project root, run all the Mocha tests with `mocha tests/sorts` and `mocha tests/data structures`.

(You&rsquo;ll need Node and npm, of course, plus Mocha installed globally. Also, you might need to make the task-runner scripts executable on your machine.)
