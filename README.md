JS: Data Structures, Algorithms, Patterns, and More
===================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/david-davidson/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Javascript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/david-davidson/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Javascript)

This is an ongoing collection of interesting and/or useful data structures, algorithms, and patterns. (Many are ported over from Sedgewick and Wayne&rsquo;s [*Algorithms*](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), 4th ed., and Stoyan Stefanov&rsquo;s excellent [*JavaScript Patterns*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806767.do).)

Curious? Clone it, make sure you have Node and npm (plus Mocha installed globally), and grab the dependencies with `npm install`. Then run all the Mocha tests with `mocha tests/**/*`, or interact with the executable files by navigating into `bin/` and running them there&mdash;e.g., `./selectionSort 3 1 2`. (You might need to make the `bin/` scripts executable on your machine.)

Enjoy!
