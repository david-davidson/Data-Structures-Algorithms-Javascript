JS: Data Structures, Algorithms, Patterns, and More
===================================================

This is an ongoing collection of JavaScript examples that I find interesting or useful: mostly algorithms and data structures (many of them ported over from Sedgewick and Wayne&rsquo;s excellent *Algorithms*, 4th ed), but also patterns that are specific to JS (e.g., scopes and closures) and/or just plain interesting (e.g., currying).

Curious? Clone it, make sure you have Node and npm (plus Mocha installed globally), and grab the dependencies with `npm install`. Then run all the Mocha tests with `mocha tests/**/*`, or interact with the executable files by navigating into `bin/` and running them there&mdash;e.g., `./selectionSort 3 1 2`. (You might need to make the `bin/` scripts executable on your machine.)

Enjoy!
